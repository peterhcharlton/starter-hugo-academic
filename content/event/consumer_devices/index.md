title: Using consumer devices for clinical assessment

event: Seminar

location: Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge

summary: The state-of-the-art and future for consumer devices in clinical assessment 
abstract: In this talk I provided an introduction to consumer devices, summarising their history, form factors and functionality. I then described potential clinical applications of consumer devices, including identifying atrial fibrillation, respiratory monitoring, and assessing vascular age. Finally, I outlined directions for future research to realise the potential of consumer devices for clinical assessment.
