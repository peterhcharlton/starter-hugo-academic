title: Using consumer wearables for clinical decision making

event: Mobile and Wearable Health [Seminar Series](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/172414)

location: University of Cambridge

summary: A presentation on using consumer devices such as smart watches for clinical decision making.
abstract: Physiological measurement devices are widely integrated into clinical practice, ranging from blood pressure measurement in primary care, to continuous oxygen saturation monitoring in intensive care. Consumer wearables such as smartwatches potentially provide opportunity to monitor health and detect diseases unobtrusively outside of the clinical setting, in daily life. However, much work is required to establish pathways to use consumer wearables for clinical decision making. In this talk, Peter Charlton will present an introduction to consumer wearables, focusing on the capabilities provided by photoplethysmography and electrocardiography sensors. He will then summarise potential clinical applications, highlighting contributions from his research towards making these applications a reality. Finally, he will share some areas for consideration to ensure consumer wearables can be used robustly for clinical decision making.
