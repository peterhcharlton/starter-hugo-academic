title: A database for developing pulse wave analysis algorithms

event: BioMedEng18

location: Imperial College London, UK

summary: An introduction to modelling arterial pulse waves. 
abstract: In this training event I provided an introduction to modelling arterial pulse waves, summarising how arterial pulse waves can be simulated using a computational model of blood flow around the body. I then demonstrated the utility of such modelling in three case studies. Finally, I summarised the limitations of this type of modelling, its benefits, and opportunities for further research.
