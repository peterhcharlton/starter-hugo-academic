### A new network for research into multimodal AI

The UK Open Multimodal AI Network (UKOMAIN) is a national initiative funded by the EPSRC with a &#163;1.8 million grant, led by the University of Sheffield. It aims to advance innovation in multimodal AI by integrating diverse data types - such as electronic health record, imaging, and wearable data to name but a few - to address pressing societal challenges, including in healthcare.

The network will provide funding for collaborative research; opportunities to network and develop multidisciplinary collaborations; events to showcase your work; and workshops and resources to help learn more about multimodal AI.
