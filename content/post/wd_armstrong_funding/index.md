## PhD Funding

Peter Charlton and his colleagues have received funding for a PhD studentship on the topic of 'Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Screening for Atrial Fibrillation'.

The student will have opportunity to develop a clinical decision support tool to aid ECG interpretation for use in AF screening studies. They will develop valuable skills in both engineering and clinical domains, supervised by researchers in clinical and engineering disciplines.

## Further details

The closing date has now passed for applications.
