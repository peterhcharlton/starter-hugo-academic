## Recognition from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering

In 2021, Peter Charlton and his colleagues received a Best Paper Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. This award recognises the outstanding contribution made by their paper titled:

_[Breathing rate estimation from the electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram: a review](/publication/rr_review/)_

The paper is often amongst the [most popular papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/topAccessedArticles.jsp?punumber=4664312) published in the journal of _IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering_.

## Further details

The paper received the 3rd Prize in the 2021 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Prize Paper Award. To find out more, see [the paper](/publication/rr_review/), and the wider [Project](/project/rr-wearables/) in which this paper sits, developing respiratory rate algorithms for wearables.
