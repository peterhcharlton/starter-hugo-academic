## Overview

Initial testing of candidate devices for the [SAFER Wearables Study](/project/safer-wearables/) was described in [this post](/post/safer_wearables_testing) and [this post](/post/safer_wearables_testing2). Two of the key questions remaining after the testing so far were:
1. Can the PulseOn OHR device be used in 'sample mode' to increase battery life?
2. How many ECGs can the Withings Move ECG store?

This post describes a third round of testing designed to answer these questions.

## Devices

The devices under test were:
- **Photoplethysmography-based wristband**: The [Max-Health-Band](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/sensor-interface/MAX-HEALTHBAND.html) was used to record photoplethysmogram (PPG) and accelerometry (accel) signals at the wrist. PPG signals were sampled at 25 Hz (green and ambient), and tri-axis accel signals were also sampled at 25 Hz. The data were stored on the device during testing, and then downloaded via a mobile phone after each test had finished.
- **Electrocardiography-based wristband**: The [Withings Move ECG](https://www.withings.com/uk/en/move-ecg) device was used to acquire 30-second ECG recordings on demand (when the user activated the ECG recording).

## Protocol

A single user performed the following tests: 
- **Photoplethysmography-based wristband**: This device was fully charged, and then worn continuously in 'continuous mode' until the battery ran out. The data were downloaded to a mobile phone, and it was then fully charged again and worn continuously in 'sample mode' until the battery ran out.
- **Electrocardiography-based wristband**: ECGs were downloaded from the device, and then 20 ECGs recordings were taken in quick succession. The data were then downloaded to a mobile phone.

## Outcomes

### Duration of wristband data in each mode

...

### Number of ECGs stored in internal memory

...

### Leads with only two electrodes

## Learning points

During this testing we learnt:
1. **Wristband use**: ...
2. **ECG watch memory**:
