## Overview

Vascular ageing is a natural process by which the function and structure of blood vessels degrade over time. It can manifest as elevated blood pressure, increased arterial stiffness, and atherosclerosis. Current approaches to assess vascular age have been found to be predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but are often not convenient enough for widespread use.

This group of European researchers is investigating the use of photoplethysmography to assess vascular age. Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive optical technique for measuring the arterial pulse wave, providing information on the state of the heart and blood vessels. The group is part of the wider [VascAgeNet network](https://vascagenet.eu/). 

## Work to date

The group have co-authored several publications, the most important of which is a review on assessing vascular age from the photoplethysmogram:
1. Assessing Vascular Age from the Photoplethysmogram: A Review from VascAgeNet
2. [Blood Pressure Estimation Based on Photoplethysmography: Finger versus Wrist](/publication/cinc21_bp_estimation/)
3. [Wearable photoplethysmography devices](/publication/wearable_ppg_chapter/)

## Invited Talks

The following speakers have given invited talks to the group:
- **Kevin Kotzen**: _Benchmarking Photoplethysmography Peak Detection Algorithms Using the Electrocardiogram Signal as a Reference_
- **Birute Paliakaite**: _Blood Pressure Estimation Based on Photoplethysmography: Finger versus Wrist_

## Group Members

The work of the group would not be possible without the hard work of its members, who are:
- [Dr Peter Charlton](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/) is a Biomedical Engineer specialising in signal processing techniques for the photoplethysmogram (PPG), including estimating respiratory rate and assessing vascular age from the PPG. He presently holds a British Heart Foundation Fellowship at the University of Cambridge.
- [Birute Paliakaite](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YtQF4uUAAAAJ&hl=en) is a researcher specialising in PPG signal processing and modelling, and has made key contributions on acquiring haemodynamic parameters from wearables, and detecting and modelling arrhythmias in the PPG.
- [Dr Kristjan Pilt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IJ5MsM4AAAAJ&hl=en) has developed novel techniques to assess vascular age from the PPG in his research, and has demonstrated their potential clinical utility in diabetic patients.
- [Dr Martin Bachler](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=pHHJAv4AAAAJ&hl=de) is a research engineer in the field of clinical diagnostics and therapy support, and specialises in biomedical signal analysis.
- [Serena Zanelli](http://vascagenet.eu/what-are-you-working-on-serena-zanelli) develops machine learning and deep learning models to detect cardiovascular disease from PPG signals acquired by wearables, working in both academic and clinical settings.
- [Dr Daniel Kulin](http://vascagenet.eu/what-are-you-working-on-dr-daniel-kulin) is a medical doctor, researcher and entrepreneur in the field of PPG-based pulse wave analysis and in the development of remote patient monitoring systems.
