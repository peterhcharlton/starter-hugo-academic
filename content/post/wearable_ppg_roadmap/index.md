## Overview

The ['2023 Wearable Photoplethysmography Roadmap'](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/acead2), which explores the full potential of wearable photoplethysmography and outlines directions for research and development, was published today in Physiological Measurement. The work draws together contributions from over 50 experts, covering 24 key topics within the areas of sensor design, signal processing, clinical applications, and research directions. It is free to download and we hope you will find it a useful guide to future research and development.
