## Overview

I recently had a look into the functionality of consumer wearables to understand the state-of-the-art. This post summarises the findings, and further details are provided in the following book chapter: [Wearable Photoplethysmography Devices](/publication/wearable_ppg_chapter/).

## Functionality

The functionality of selected consumer wearables is summarised in the table below.
