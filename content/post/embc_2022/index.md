Peter Charlton participated in three sessions at the 2022 [IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference](https://embc.embs.org/2022/):

### Workshop on Open research in Biomedical Signal Processing

Peter presented a workshop on 'Open research in Biomedical Signal Processing - Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Using the MIMIC-IV Database', working with colleagues at MIT and City, University of Cambridge. The workshop provided participants with the knowledge, skills and tools required to conduct open research in the field of Biomedical Signal Processing. It included a formal announcement of the release of the MIMIC-IV Waveform Database, and hands-on experience of using MIMIC data for cuffless blood pressure estimation.

### Presentation on 'Wearable photoplethysmography devices for cardiovascular monitoring'

Peter was invited to present at a mini-symposium on 'Innovations in Photoplethysmography', organised by Prof. John Allen and Prof. Panicos Kyriacou. Peter's presentation provided an introduction to the fundamentals of photoplethysmography, summarised emerging clinical applications, and highlighted pressing areas for future research. Further details of the talk are available [here](/talk/wearable-photoplethysmography-devices-for-cardiovascular-monitoring/), including the slides.

### Presentation on 'Prioritising ECGs for manual review in atrial fibrillation screening'

Peter presented work by members of the Department of Public Health and Primary Care on 'Prioritising ECGs for manual review in atrial fibrillation (AF) screening'. The presentation focused on a novel approach to identify ECGs for clinical review in screening for AF, which is designed to minimise the number of ECGs sent for review (and therefore the reviewing workload), whilst still ensuring accurate AF diagnoses. Further details of the talk are available [here](/talk/prioritising-ecgs-for-manual-review-in-atrial-fibrillation-screening/).
