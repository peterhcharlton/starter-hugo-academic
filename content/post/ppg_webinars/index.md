Photoplethysmography is widely used for physiological monitoring in clinical and consumer devices. It is a highly active area of research, with many important developments being made each year. In 2022 we will hold monthly webinars to showcase the latest research and thinking on key topics within the field of photoplethysmography. Each webinar will consist of a series of talks from leaders in the field. All are welcome to attend.

## Webinars

### Webinar 1: Simulating photoplethysmography signals
<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _27 January 2022, 14:00 GMT ([other time zones](https://dateful.com/convert/greenwich-mean-time-gmt?t=14&d=2021-01-27))_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Hosted by the _Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine_

{{< cta cta_text="Book Now" cta_link="https://www.ipem.ac.uk/Conferences-Events/Upcoming-IPEM-Events/Event-Details/dateid/643" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

**Overview:**

Several techniques have recently been developed to simulate photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, providing data with which to develop PPG signal processing algorithms, and providing insight into the physiological origins of the signal. This webinar will feature talks from researchers who have developed complementary techniques to simulate PPG signals. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art, and highlight pressing directions for future research.

**Speakers:**

- **Andrius Solosenko (Kaunas University of Technology)** will present on modelling photoplethysmogram signals during atrial fibrillation.
- **Cheng Ding (Emory University)** will present a novel approach to simulating PPG signals using generative adversarial networks.
- **Dr James May (City, University of London)** will present on _in vitro_ simulation of photoplethysmography signals.
- **Dr Jordi Alastruey-Arimon (King's College London)** will present on the role of in silico pulse wave databases in machine learning-based pulse wave analysis.

### Webinar 2: Developments in Photoplethysmography
<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _February / March 2022_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i>  Hosted by _[Physiological Measurement](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334)_

**Overview:**

Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive, optical measurement technique which is widely used for health monitoring. Much research focuses on how to leverage the wealth of information in the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, and how to use this information to inform clinical decisions. This webinar will feature talks from leaders in the field, on topics ranging from using photoplethysmography for cardiovascular risk assessment, cuff-less blood pressure monitoring, and validating these technologies for clinical use. It will provide insight into the state-of-the-art and key directions for future research.

**Speakers:**

- **Ramakrishna Mukkamala (University of Pittsburgh)**
- **Rich Fletcher (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)**, author of _'[The use of multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) as a screening tool for coronary arterial disease and atherosclerosis](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abad48)'_ which was recently published in Physiological Measurement.
- **Raquel Bail&oacute;n Luesma, (University of Zaragoza)**
- **Xiaoman Xing (Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology)**, author of _'[Blood pressure assessment with in-ear photoplethysmography](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ac2a71)'_ which was recently published in Physiological Measurement.

### Webinar 3: Photoplethysmography signal quality
<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _March 2022_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Hosted by the _Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine_

**Overview:**

The photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal contains a wealth of information. However, the PPG is highly susceptible to noise, which can corrupt the information in the signal. Consequently, much research has focused on assessing PPG signal quality and reducing motion artifact. This webinar will feature talks from researchers in the field of PPG signal quality, providing an overview of current work in the field and future research directions.

### Webinar 4: Clinical applications of photoplethysmography
<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _April 2022_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Hosted by the _Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine_

**Overview:**

This webinar will highlight emerging clinical applications of photoplethysmography. Photoplethysmography has traditionally been used in pulse oximeters for oxygen saturation and heart rate monitoring. Recently, several additional clinical applications have been proposed, ranging from screening newborn infants for critical congenital heart disease, to sleep apnea assessment, to identifying atrial fibrillation in everyday life. This webinar will feature talks from researchers who are pushing the boundaries of photoplethysmography, developing approaches to use it to enhance healthcare in a range of settings.
