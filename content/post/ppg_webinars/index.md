Photoplethysmography is widely used for physiological monitoring in clinical and consumer devices. It is a highly active area of research, with many important developments being made each year. In 2022 we will hold monthly webinars to showcase the latest research and thinking on key topics within the field of photoplethysmography. Each webinar will consist of a series of talks from leaders in the field. All are welcome to attend.

## Webinars

### Simulating photoplethysmography signals
_27 January 2022, 14:00 GMT ([other time zones](https://dateful.com/convert/greenwich-mean-time-gmt?t=14&d=2021-01-27))_

{{< cta cta_text="Book Now" cta_link="https://www.ipem.ac.uk/Conferences-Events/Upcoming-IPEM-Events/Event-Details/dateid/643" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

Several techniques have recently been developed to simulate photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, providing data with which to develop PPG signal processing algorithms, and providing insight into the physiological origins of the signal. This webinar will feature talks from researchers who have developed complementary techniques to simulate PPG signals. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art, and highlight pressing directions for future research.

Speakers include:

- **Andrius Solosenko (Kaunas University of Technology)** will present on modelling photoplethysmogram signals during atrial fibrillation.
- **Cheng Ding (Emory University)** will present a novel approach to simulating PPG signals using generative adversarial networks.
- **Dr James May (City, University of London)** will present on _in vitro_ simulation of photoplethysmography signals.
- **Dr Jordi Alastruey-Arimon (King's College London)** will present on the role of in silico pulse wave databases in machine learning-based pulse wave analysis.
