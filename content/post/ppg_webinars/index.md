## Upcoming Webinars

### Photoplethysmography signal processing
<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _9 June 2022, 14:00 British Summer Time ([other time zones](https://dateful.com/convert/british-summer-time-bst?t=14&d=2022-06-09))_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Hosted by the _[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/)_

**Overview:**

The photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal contains a wealth of information. However, there are several challenges to extracting physiological measurements from the PPG. Firstly, the PPG is highly susceptible to noise, which can corrupt the information in the signal. Consequently, much research has focused on assessing PPG signal quality and reducing motion artifact. Secondly, the PPG is often only indirectly affected by the physiology of interest, making it a challenge to extract physiological measurements such as blood pressure. This webinar will feature talks from researchers in the field of PPG signal processing, providing an overview of current work in the field and future research directions.

**Speakers:**

- **Xiaorong Ding (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)** will present on _Exploiting Photoplethysmogram Features for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation_.
- **Serena Zanelli (Paris Sorbonne Nord University)** will present on _Deep learning approach to detect signal quality from clinical to non-clinical PPG devices_ ([accompanying paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629640)).

### Developments in Photoplethysmography
<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _7 July 2022, 14:00 British Summer Time ([other time zones](https://dateful.com/convert/british-summer-time-bst?t=14&d=2022-07-07))_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Hosted by the _[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/)_

**Overview:**

Photoplethysmography is an optical sensing technique that is widely used in clinical and consumer devices. It is a highly active area of research, with many important developments being made each year. In this webinar leaders in the field will present their latest research. Topics include extracting measurements of pulse rate variability from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) for applications such as stress monitoring, and using phantoms to investigate the origins of the PPG and develop new PPG sensing technologies.

**Speakers:**

- **James May (City, University of London)** will present on _Phantoms for In Vitro Investigations of PPG and PPG technology Development_.
- **Elisa Mejia-Mejia (City, University of London)** will present on _Photoplethysmography-based pulse rate variability: standardisation of the technique using simulated signals_.
- **James Anibal (University of Oxford)** will present on _Attention methods for longer PPG sequences_.

### Webinar 1: Simulating photoplethysmography signals

<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _27 January 2022, 14:00 GMT ([other time zones](https://dateful.com/convert/greenwich-mean-time-gmt?t=14&d=2021-01-27))_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Hosted by the _[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine](https://www.ipem.ac.uk/)_

**Overview:**

Several techniques have recently been developed to simulate photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, providing data with which to develop PPG signal processing algorithms, and providing insight into the physiological origins of the signal. This webinar will feature talks from researchers who have developed complementary techniques to simulate PPG signals. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art, and highlight pressing directions for future research.

**Speakers:**

- **Andrius Solosenko (Kaunas University of Technology)** presented on modelling photoplethysmogram signals during atrial fibrillation.
- **Cheng Ding (Emory University)** presented a novel approach to simulating PPG signals using generative adversarial networks.
- **Dr Jordi Alastruey-Arimon (King's College London)** presented on the role of _in silico_ pulse wave databases in machine learning-based pulse wave analysis.

### Webinar 2: Recent Advances in Photoplethysmography

<i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> _3 March 2022, 14:00 GMT ([other time zones](https://dateful.com/convert/greenwich-mean-time-gmt?t=14&d=2022-03-03))_

<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i>  Hosted by _[Physiological Measurement](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334)_

{{< cta cta_text="Watch Again" cta_link="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/5108458986808048397" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

**Overview:**

Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive, optical measurement technique which is widely used for health monitoring. Much research focuses on how to leverage the wealth of information in the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, and how to use this information to inform clinical decisions. This webinar will feature talks from leaders in the field, on topics ranging from using photoplethysmography for cardiovascular risk assessment, for cuff-less blood pressure monitoring, and validating these technologies for clinical use. It will provide insight into the state-of-the-art and key directions for future research.

**Speakers:**

- **Rich Fletcher (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)** presented on _'[The use of multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) as a screening tool for coronary arterial disease and atherosclerosis](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abad48)'_, which was recently published in _Physiological Measurement_.
- **Raquel Bail&oacute;n Luesma, (University of Zaragoza)** presented on _'Applications of PPG waveform decomposition analysis'_.
- **Ramakrishna Mukkamala (University of Pittsburgh)** presented on _[Evaluation of Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurement Devices: Challenges and Proposals](https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.17747)_, highlighting work which was recently published in _Hypertension_.
