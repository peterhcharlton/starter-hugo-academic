## Turning toddlers onto engineering through storytelling

In 2021, I participated in this project, which aimed 'to turn toddlers onto engineering through the power of storytelling' [detailed here](https://www.storytellingengineers.com/about). Funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering, I was part of a cohort of engineers who were given the opportunity to write a story for 2-5 year olds to introduce them to Engineering. We were given training, feedback throughout the writing process, and the opportunity to be professionally recorded reading our story.

## Sally and the Snotbuster

I wrote a story about Sally, a young girl who likes making machines to help people. When her brother is sick and cannot sleep because of the snot blocking his airways, she starts working on a machine to detect the presence of snot, and then (gently) such it out without waking him up. Her broother is not impressed, and neither are her parents. Will she overcome the challenges? Find out in the story, available here:
