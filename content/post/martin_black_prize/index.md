## Recognition from the Institute of Physics (IOP) and Institute of Physics in Engineering and Medicine (IPEM)

In 2023, Peter Charlton and his colleagues received the [Martin Black Prize](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/page/Martin_Black_award) for the best paper published in _Physiological Measurement_ during the previous year. This award recognises the outstanding contribution made by their paper titled:

_[Detecting beats in the photoplethysmogram: benchmarking open-source algorithms](/publication/assess_ppg_beat_detectors/)_

## Media coverage in Physics World

The prize was covered in [this Physics World article](https://physicsworld.com/a/heartbeat-detection-in-smartwatch-signals-wins-physiological-measurement-best-paper-award/).

## Further details

To find out more, see [the paper](/publication/assess_ppg_beat_detectors/), and the wider [Project](/project/ppg-beats/) in which this paper sits, developing algorithms to detect heartbeats in photoplethysmography signals.
