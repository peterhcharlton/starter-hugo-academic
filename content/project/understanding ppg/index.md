## Overview
A set of resources to aid the beginner and expert alike in understanding photoplethysmography.

### An introduction to photoplethysmography

- **A comprehensive overview:** [This review paper](/publication/wearable_ppg_review/) summarises the fundamentals of photoplethysmography, its use in wearables, signal processing, and its potential clinical applications.

- **A very quick overview:** [This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnXDvN4WNX8) provides an introduction to photoplethysmography in a minute (and a bit).

### Wearable photoplethysmography devices
- **The state-of-the-art in wearable photoplethysmography:** Our [book chapter on wearable photoplethysmography devices](/publication/wearable_ppg_chapter/) provides an overview of the state-of-the-art.

### Signal processing
- **A comprehensive overview of PPG signal processing:** Our [book chapter on photoplethysmography signal processing](/publication/ppg_sig_proc_chapter/) provides an overview of a wide range of techniques for processing the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal.
- **Respiratory rate estimation:** If you're interested in estimating respiratory rate from the PPG, then see our [review paper](/publication/rr_review/) on the topic.
- **Vascular age:** If you're interested in assessing vascular age from the PPG, then see our [review paper](/publication/vascagenet_ppg_review/) on the topic. Includes: blood pressure estimation, assessing arterial stiffness, and identifying peripheral arterial disease. If you're interested in this topic, then you might consider joining [this working group](/post/vascagenet_ppg_group/), part of [VascAgeNet](https://vascagenet.eu/), a network for research into vascular ageing.

### Clinical applications
- **Opportunities for photoplethysmography in public health:** [This presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQ16Cdxxto) provides an overview of some potential applications of photoplethysmography in Public Health.

### The latest developments in photoplethysmography
