In this project we created a database of simulated arterial pulse waves for in silico testing of pulse wave analysis algorithms. The database includes photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse waves, which are widely measured by wearables such as smartwatches. It is a valuable resource for future research.

Further details on the project are available [here](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb/).
