## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop techniques to assess vascular ageing in daily life, providing information on the state of the blood vessels which could be used to personalise cardiovascular treatments.

## Background

Vascular age is an emerging indicator of cardiovascular health that is indicative of cardiovascular risk, and can prompt clinical intervention. The function and structure of blood vessels naturally degrade with age. This process, known as vascular aging, can ultimately result in damage to the heart, kidney, and brain. Indicators of vascular aging have been found to be predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality, so may be useful for cardiovascular risk stratification. _Source: modified from [Charlton P.H. et al.](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00392.2021), under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)_.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop techniques to assess vascular ageing from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) - the pulse wave signal measured by smartwatches, activity trackers, and pulse oximeters. 

## Methods

We are using both simulated and real-world data to design signal processing techniques to extract indicators of vascular ageing from the PPG, and to assess their potential clinical utility.

## Results

Initial results are reported in the publications listed below.
