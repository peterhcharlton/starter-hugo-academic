abstract: An abnormal respiratory rate is often the earliest sign of critical illness.
  A reliable estimate of respiratory rate is vital in the application of remote telemonitoring
  systems, which may facilitate early supported discharge from hospital or prompt
  recognition of physiological deterioration in high-risk patient groups. Traditional
  approaches use analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia from the electrocardiogram
  (ECG), but this phenomenon is predominantly limited to the young and healthy. Analysis
  of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform offers an alternative means of non-invasive
  respiratory rate monitoring, but further development is required to enable reliable
  estimates. This review conceptualizes the challenge by discussing the effect of
  respiration on the PPG waveform and the key physiological mechanisms that underpin
  the derivation of respiratory rate from the PPG.
