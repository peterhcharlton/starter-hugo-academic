abstract: Photoplethysmography is now widely utilised by clinical devices such as pulse oximeters, and wearable devices such as smartwatches. It holds great promise for health monitoring in daily life. This editorial considers whether it would be possible and beneficial to establish best practices for photoplethysmography signal acquisition and processing. It reports progress made towards this, balanced with the challenges of working with a diverse range of photoplethysmography device designs and intended applications, each of which could benefit from different approaches to signal acquisition and processing. It concludes that there are several potential benefits to establishing best practices. However, it is not yet clear whether it is possible to establish best practices which hold across the range of photoplethysmography device designs and applications.
