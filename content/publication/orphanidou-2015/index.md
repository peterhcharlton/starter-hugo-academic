abstract: The identification of invalid data in recordings obtained using wearable
  sensors is of particular importance since data obtained from mobile patients is,
  in general, noisier than data obtained from nonmobile patients. In this paper, we
  present a signal quality index (SQI), which is intended to assess whether reliable
  heart rates (HRs) can be obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram
  (PPG) signals collected using wearable sensors. The algorithms were validated on
  manually labeled data. Sensitivities and specificities of 94% and 97% were achieved
  for the ECG and 91% and 95% for the PPG. Additionally, we propose two applications
  of the SQI. First, we demonstrate that, by using the SQI as a trigger for a power-saving
  strategy, it is possible to reduce the recording time by up to 94% for the ECG and
  93% for the PPG with only minimal loss of valid vital-sign data. Second, we demonstrate
  how an SQI can be used to reduce the error in the estimation of respiratory rate
  (RR) from the PPG. The performance of the two applications was assessed on data
  collected from a clinical study on hospital patients who were able to walk unassisted.
