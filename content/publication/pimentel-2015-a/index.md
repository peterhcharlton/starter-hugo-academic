abstract: 'Respiration rate (RR) is a physiological parameter that is typically used
  in clinical settings for monitoring patient condition. Consequently, it is measured
  in a wide range of clinical scenarios, notably absent from which is measurement
  using wearable sensors. With increasing numbers of patients being monitored via
  wearable sensors, as described below, there is an urgent need to be able to estimate
  RR from such sensors in a robust manner. In this chapter, we describe a novel technique
  for measuring RR using waveform data acquired from wearable sensors. The technique
  derives RR from a physiological signal which is routinely acquired by many mobile
  sensors: the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Each RR measurement from the proposed method
  is accompanied by a confidence measure, providing estimates of clinical quality
  that will allow the system to, for example, only report RR values when they exceed
  some probabilistic level of certainty. The goal of this method is to improve upon
  existing methods, which simply report RR values without probabilistic estimation,
  and which therefore suffer the lack of robustness that prevents their use in clinical
  practice.'
