abstract: 'Wireless sensors may aid detection of clinical deteriorations in hospital patients. Potential routes for translating this technology into changed patient outcomes are discussed, whilst acknowledging the challenges associated with its integration into clinical practice. Results from a clinical trial investigating the feasibility and efficacy of continuous inpatient monitoring using wireless sensors will be presented.'
