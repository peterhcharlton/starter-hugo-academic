abstract: Attractor reconstruction (AR) analysis has been used previously to quantify
  the variability in arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Since ABP signals are
  only available in a minority of clinical scenarios, we sought to determine whether
  AR could also be performed on more widely available photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. 
  AR analysis was performed on simultaneous ABP and PPG signals before, during and
  after a change in cardiovascular state. A novel quality metric was used to eliminate
  windows of low quality AR. A high level of agreement was found between the detected
  periodicity of each signal. The remaining cardiovascular parameters derived using
  AR analysis exhibited similar trends between the two signals in response to the
  change in state, although there was poor agreement between their absolute values.
  This demonstrates the feasibility of applying AR to the PPG signal, increasing the
  range of patients in whom cardiovascular state can be measured using AR analysis.
