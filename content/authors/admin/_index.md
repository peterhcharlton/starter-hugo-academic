Peter Charlton is a British Heart Foundation Research Fellow in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, at the University of Cambridge. He specialises in the development of biomedical signal processing techniques to aid clinical decision making. He gained the degree of M.Eng. in Engineering Science in 2010 from the University of Oxford with first class honours. From 2010 to 2020, Peter conducted his research at King?s College London (KCL), developing techniques to continuously monitor respiratory and cardiovascular health using wearable sensors. His Ph.D. focused on using signal processing and machine learning techniques to identify acute deteriorations in hospital patients. In 2020, Peter was awarded a five-year fellowship to develop techniques to use clinical and consumer devices to enhance screening for atrial fibrillation. He works in collaboration with clinicians and industrial partners to translate his work into clinical practice.
