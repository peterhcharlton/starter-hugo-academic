abstract = {Respiration rate (RR) is a physiological parameter that is typically used in clinical settings for monitoring patient condition. Consequently, it is measured in a wide range of clinical scenarios, notably absent from which is measurement using wearable sensors. With increasing numbers of patients being monitored via wearable sensors, as described below, there is an urgent need to be able to estimate RR from such sensors in a robust manner. In this chapter, we describe a novel technique for measuring RR using waveform data acquired from wearable sensors. The technique derives RR from a physiological signal which is routinely acquired by many mobile sensors: the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Each RR measurement from the proposed method is accompanied by a confidence measure, providing estimates of clinical quality that will allow the system to, for example, only report RR values when they exceed some probabilistic level of certainty. The goal of this method is to improve upon existing methods, which simply report RR values without probabilistic estimation, and which therefore suffer the lack of robustness that prevents their use in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Attractor reconstruction (AR) analysis has been used previously to quantify the variability in arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Since ABP signals are only available in a minority of clinical scenarios, we sought to determine whether AR could also be performed on more widely available pho-toplethysmogram (PPG) signals. AR analysis was performed on simultaneous ABP and PPG signals before, during and after a change in cardiovascular state. A novel quality metric was used to eliminate windows of low quality AR. A high level of agreement was found between the detected periodicity of each signal. The remaining cardiovascular parameters derived using AR analysis exhibited similar trends between the two signals in response to the change in state, although there was poor agreement between their absolute values. This demonstrates the feasibility of applying AR to the PPG signal, increasing the range of patients in whom cardiovascular state can be measured using AR analysis.},
